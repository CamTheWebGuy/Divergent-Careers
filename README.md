## Description

I started this project with the goal of learning more about NextJS and Tailwind CSS. This has been my first time working with both of these.

I also wanted to create something that wasn't just the generic AirBNB or Netflix Clone (which I've started and stopped several times in the past) but an actual project related to something near and dear to me.

Something that could be used in the real world and that I could build from scratch.
